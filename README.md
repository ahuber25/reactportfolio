For Module 20, the challenge was to make our old portfolio into a react portfolio, have the ability to change between the different sections, and to have an interactive layout. I was able to create it and deploy it to both github and heroku without any major errors. I was not able to add a resume page because I lost mine when my compute had to be wiped clean not too long ago and I have yet to make a new one.

Here is the link to the deployed site on heroku.
