            <p>Hello there. My name is Acadia Huber, but I prefer to go by Caid. I am twenty-six years old and have been casually messing with code for almost a decade now. I began on tumblr where I would run different writing blogs and would want to have a theme to match the character I was writing on said blog. Though most of my experience comes from using a free code provided by another creator, I became familiar with the concept and layout the more I practiced.</p>
            <p>Last year was the first time I had ever taken a formal class, in which I took Rutger's online Front-End Web Developer course. As much as that helped me to improve my skills, I did not feel I retained enough information or learned as much as I felt I should have. So I decided to take this course and further develop my skills. This will be the site where I host all that I have done so far, and I am certain it is going to only become more developed and nicer the more I learn.</p>
